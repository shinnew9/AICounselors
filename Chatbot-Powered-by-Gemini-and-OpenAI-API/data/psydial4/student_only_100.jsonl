Can you say more about what it feels like inside you when you feel like you're scattered? Will these feelings make you any better?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I think that the \"disperse\" situation is the key to my learning problems. I think it's the kind of stress that makes my grades worse. This trial is the kind of pressure that inspires me, but it's more of a stressful and anxiety that makes me feel."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I see. What are the circumstances under which you usually feel like you're letting yourself go to the music, the knowledge, the tweets? How long will these things last? Is there anything else that bothers you about not being able to take on this part of yourself?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "This situation sometimes lasts for hours, even full-time. It's a big one, because it takes up the time I planned to study and work. Yes, I can't accept my own failure, and I can't accept my lack of effort."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You seem to have difficulty accepting your performance in these areas, and I understand how you feel. Are these platforms really attractive to you, and you can't control yourself?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, those platforms are easy to get addicted to, and slow down. I feel really bad and feel guilty about seeing myself like this."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I can feel you wanting to be better at managing your time and tasks. What kind of change would you want if you could take up this part of yourself?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I really hope I can be more tolerant, but I can't help feeling self-pity every time I fail."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "How can you feel guilty?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It may be related to my background, and I have high expectations from my childhood home and school, and I feel that I have failed when I have not met expectations."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you're very anxious not to meet expectations."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, but sometimes I'm afraid to find myself too smart or unsuited to waste time."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You mentioned being too smart.

And you want to do something that brings a sense of accomplishment, is that it?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it's important. The difference is that the process of reading is calm and pleasant, but it does not bring the obvious results, so it's contradictory."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, reading gives you peace and pleasure, but you also want to see the obvious. Can you tell me why you feel that contradiction?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, because those things bring me confidence and achievement, and I know I can do it, I'm more willing to do it."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "So you think you're better at getting a sense of achievement and self-confidence, and have you ever tried to set goals or plans for something like reading books?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I like to read psychology and English books, which makes me feel like I'm making progress, but there's no outstanding results on the surface. When I do other things, I give myself a clear time and results to make sure that it's done."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like reading is a process that makes you feel progressive and enriched. What was your experience in reading?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "The process was pleasant, rich, and it allowed me to learn new things.

Reading makes you happy and full, but at the same time you want to be able to identify your own progress, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, you can say that.

Did you feel it in elementary school?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I thought about it, probably only in junior high. It wasn't that obvious in primary school, though it was a requirement, but it wasn't that strict."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "This pressure has kept you in high school, but you've been anxious. What do you think it has to do with it?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, it keeps me in a state of high pressure, with little time to relax.

Mm-hmm, imagine!"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, the red warning signs make me nervous and stressful, but I cannot ignore their existence."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I wonder if this red sign, when it reminds you, also conveys a concern about failure. Can you describe the scenes that have made you suffer?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, if I cannot face failure, and always blame and worry, this red sign will appear more frequently. The painful scenes are one where I feel that I cannot accomplish my mission as planned and that I have failed."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand that the scenes you have mentioned are very disturbing and stressful. Have you any of those who have been brave enough to deal with these pressures and to face failure? What kind of people are they?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I will think of those who are brave and not afraid of failure.

I would think that success is not just the end point, but more the growth and experience of the journey. At the same time, I fear that I am not good enough, strong enough, and unable to meet expectations."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You mention that fear of being not good enough and strong is very important to you.

We had a good relationship, but I didn't write her congratulations because of the Internet class, and she seemed to think I didn't really want to make her a friend, so she got a little less connected."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I see, it seems to be a misunderstanding."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Then, when the team worked with the other two, she had a problem with the other team, and finally I finished the work with the other student. When the grades came up, she went to the theory of two people who had been in conflict with her before, and said that the finished stuff was all I did, like I was trying to get in the middle of a fight, trying to make a mistake. I knew it later, and I thought she was a little bit of a mess."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It sounds like things really uncomfortable and confusing to you."}, {"role": "user", "text": "In fact, I didn't know she was behind this if it wasn't for those two girls who told me.

Can you tell us more about what happened?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "And she's not really doing anything, but she's trying to distance herself from me and she's having a very rigid relationship with two other students.

So what did you do when you tried to relax your relationship?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I came to them, and I expressed my apologies for having them talk, hoping that we could get back to being together."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "That sounds like a lot of courage. How do you say that?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I told them that I had been unaware of not writing to her, but not of being a friend, hoping that she would understand my difficulties.

Can you elaborate on how you felt?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I said, \"I'm sorry, I didn't congratulate you on your last birthday. I'm really sorry. I don't value our friendship, I just neglected.

Does that mean anything to you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I mean the girl who had her birthday."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, I understand. How was her relationship with the other two roommates before the semester?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "She was a good friend of the other two, but she was not that close, but she was quite harmonious."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You know, we were all in a better relationship. She was in good company until the semester."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it feels like everything started after her birthday, and that time without congratulations was a spark."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "After her birthday, she started to get nervous with her roommates. Did she have any specific problems with her two other roommates?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "She had some contradictions in her cooperation with two other individuals, as if because of the distribution of tasks, she felt that the other two had been left out of their hands and that the relationship had become somewhat tense."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "The relationship has become tense because of some contradictions arising from the distribution of the task of the Panel ' s cooperation."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Perhaps that's why she later picked up what she said was that I did all the finished products and caused more trouble in the relationship."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It sounds like these contradictions are making things more complicated. What do you feel in this changing relationship?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It is possible, after all, that we were actually better at the time, and others might think I was partial."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, you're holding the housemate."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I do not want her to be isolated, but her actions make it difficult for me to trust her. Now that I'm back in school, I really don't know how to face this situation."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, I understand. It sounds a very difficult question for you. You want to know about your dorm, you can share some basic information about you and your roommates?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Well, I'm a sophomore, a major in international relations, 20 years old. And the three roommates are a sophomore, one is an accountant, the other is a psychologist, and they're all about 20 years old."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It would appear that you have a lot of topics in common, although you have different professions."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Well, we're different professionals, but we still get into some common life topics and activities."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, I was thinking, maybe some of the previous experiences left an insurmountable gap. Can you tell us more about what happened?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I'm trying to keep myself out of the game, but it's hard to get rid of the creeps inside, especially in the same room."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Understandable. It's really not easy to deal with, especially in a living environment. How long has the cabinet incident that was mentioned been there?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It has been over six months, but it still feels like there are a lot of diaphragms."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Yeah? That was about a few months ago?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It's probably the end of last year. The exact time is a little confused."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I see. It's almost a semester, isn't it?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, almost a semester, but it feels like relationships are not being fixed."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Time's running fast. It's sophomore year, isn't it?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, I'm sophomore now."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It's been over a semester."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, this time it is also hoped to be dealt with in other ways, but not in the desired way."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand. Do you think there was anything else that caused misunderstanding or confusion between us that was not the case?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "In addition to that, I think there are some daily little frictions, such as hygiene cleaning, rest periods, etc., that are somewhat contradictory."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Oh, I see. This could cause some inconvenience and tension, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It was felt that since then, patience had become less and that many small issues had become more complex."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It does sound like these contradictions make the situation even more difficult."}, {"role": "user", "text": "One time we argued about cleaning, nobody wanted to do more, and then two-to-two. And I think it was after that, and it got even more distant."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "The problem of cleaning also seems to have increased tension between you, and the relationship has since become even more distant."}, {"role": "user", "text": "There are other details, such as frictions in the use of public goods and the difficulties associated with inconsistencies."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "The frictions and the different hours of work on these details do sound to increase your contradictions."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, it all happened afterwards."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It appears that these problems became more apparent after the incident in the cabinet, and perhaps the grievances that had accumulated earlier affected your relationship."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, after all, we have a lot of bumps in each other's hearts, and little things get complicated."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you've got some kind of backlog. This has a lot to do with your relationship, do you agree?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I think that this is a great possibility, and some emotions are not expressed in their hearts, but rather erupt in small things."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I can feel this bother and anxiety of yours."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I'm troubled and troubled by these things and I hope to find a solution."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It seems that there have been some subtle changes between you since the incident in that cabinet, which has affected your subsequent relationship."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, I think that event was a turning point, and then things didn't get as natural as they were."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You've been very honest about this. What do you think is the most troubling aspect of this?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It's mainly between me and the roommate who had a birthday, after all, and we're still in a good relationship, and it's kind of embarrassing, sometimes feeling like we're holding a stone in our hearts."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand how you feel, and the changes between you are really uncomfortable.

Is that it?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I do have this concern that if we can't handle relationships in our bedrooms, it may be more difficult to enter society in the future."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, I understand your concern, and I feel the importance you attach to this issue. We can spend more time with you on this. If you want, we can keep talking for a while and a few more times.

What's that?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "For example, they sometimes talk about family and love, and they have completely different views from me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You mean you don't agree with roommates when they mention their parents or when they're in love?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, some of them are too extreme to be accepted, but I'm afraid to express them."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Can you share some concrete examples?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "For example, they say that “girls should rely on their boyfriends”, and I totally disagree."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It sounds like you're troubled by their views, and you're probably tired of choosing not to express your own disagreement."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, always trying to understand them, but really tired."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, I see. In this case, have you thought about other ways of expressing your feelings?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It means that I may have a conflict with them, and I am really afraid of conflict with others and of being isolated."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you're very upset about conflict and isolation. I'm curious, how does it feel to choose not to say anything when you can't agree with these ideas?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Most of the time I choose to be patient and not to say it."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Is this a choice that you feel depressed or helpless?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, and other friends do, and they always keep quiet."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It happens when you're with other friends. You always choose not to say anything, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, especially when you're with a roommate."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "This is more obvious when you're with a roommate, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, and it's true when I'm with others, and I'm going to be able to hold it off most of the time."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "So you're avoiding your differences in relationships and your patience, which makes you uncomfortable, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it was just at first, and slowly I was less and less and less and worse."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, I noticed you're talking less and less about you and them, and you're getting worse. That does sound complicated, and we can discuss it in greater depth in the next few hours. Today's consultation is almost over.

What do you think?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, I think it might take a little more time."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "So I'll see you next time. I'll remember that.

Our current arrangement is once a week, and it allows you time to think about the content of each consultation, and it allows us to work more efficiently. If there is a need, we can adjust it flexibly."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I see, that would help me to better digest what is happening today."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "So when are you going to be more convenient next week? In order to avoid time conflicts, we can just make a time frame that suits you. Just make a direct appointment with me."}, {"role": "user", "text": "This time next week is more appropriate for me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Or is it this time of day?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I hope it's still possible in this time period."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Okay, do you want to make a long-term appointment, or do you want to add it to it first, and then next week?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I think it's a long-term one, and I'll say it in advance if I need it."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I see.

What does it make you feel so uncomfortable and meaningless?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Because I feel like I'm doing a lot of work, presentations, and formalism every day, and I never feel the satisfaction of my heart. I may be full, but I'm really empty."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you're busy, but you're not getting satisfaction from it. It makes you feel very empty, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes. Even occasionally watching a movie or going out for fun is just a temporary escape. I start to wonder about the value of living."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand that even if you try to have leisure activities, you cannot really enjoy them and start questioning the meaning of life."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, it's all gone.

I'm a positive person when I go to school, but it's been a very strong feeling lately, probably for the past six months and a year, and I'm numb."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You were a positive person when you were in school, but you were beginning to feel numb in the last six months and a year, which was particularly unbearable."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I could find something fresh at first, but slowly it disappeared, and now I can't get any interest in it."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand that trying new things at first is a little exciting, but with time, the new senses have disappeared and everything has become boring."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You know, do you think there's something that's really important to you right now that gives you some hope or motivation?

Why do you think that's happening?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, it's like everything's just about what people expect. I know people think I'm good, but I'm not happy at all."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand that this kind of unhappyness is important to you. Can you talk about more about your feelings?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I have many contradictions in my heart.

Can you tell us something?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I feel like I'm running away from real problems for a lot of time. Even now, I'm forced to adapt."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "So do you think doing what you like would help you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I know that doing what I like makes me happy, but I always feel that it is risky and that it may fail."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, you'd be happy to do these things a year ago. Does it make sense?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I began by giving myself a lot of excuses, saying it was for the sake of future security. But it was time, and I found it just self-deception."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You mean, you know, work is your favorite job, but you're running away from something?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, I'm just trying to hide my empty mind. But the more busy I get, the more I feel, the more meaningless."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, you seem to think that rest is unreasonable, that it should be, condemned, so keep trying?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, it's always thought that rest is a waste of time, and it makes me look lazy and idle."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Mm-hmm. What is that?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I feel that deep down there is a voice that keeps telling me that I must succeed and work, or I will fail."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I see, you have a high demand for success and effort, but sometimes you find that these efforts do not make any real sense, do you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, because acquiring these “values” does not make me truly happy and satisfied."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You mean, that stuff makes sense to a lot of people, but you still don't feel it, or you feel empty?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I can't feel real satisfaction even if I'm flattered."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, constantly raising yourself is your usual pattern, but you can't really get some joy from it. What are you worried about? What do you think, if you don't try, you shouldn't?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I fear that I will not be recognized by others, and that I will lose my future development opportunities. There is always a sense of unease that drives me to pursue achievements and progress."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Mm-hmm. How so?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It is always feared that once stopped, everything accumulated will be lost and it will plunge itself into deeper confusion and despair."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like it's getting very tired of you. Can you say that?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it is. But I feel like nothing is really what I really like, even if I did what I liked before, and I don't have that kind of enthusiasm."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Do you think this loss of enthusiasm has anything to do with your current state?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It was first, but then it became a mechanical repetition, and it seemed like the whole person was emptied."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, you said you felt like you were being emptied. It was a very strong feeling. What made you feel like that?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I'm getting less and less in touch with my friends, and I feel like I'm not in the same position as them. Their lives look so simple and happy, and I feel like an outsider."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you feel alienated and lonely in relationships. How does that affect you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, I feel like I'm drowning in my work. I'm gone, and there's only one fake that meets the expectations of the outside world."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It seems that the stress at work has had a great impact on you. Can you describe more of what it is like to say about what you're saying about what you're saying about what you're doing?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Of course not, but I don't know how to change, and I'm in a vicious circle."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It's a disturbing feeling, you know. Can you remember when it started?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "A year ago, I changed my job and started feeling like nothing. The direction changed, but the void in my heart remained the same."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, what prompted you to decide to change your job?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Because of the precariousness of the previous work, which often made me feel insecure, more secure work was chosen at the expense of my interests."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Uh-huh. You mean instability makes you feel insecure?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I fear an uncertain future, so I always want to seize a chance of stability, but I find it not really reassuring."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand. Have you chosen stable jobs to make you less anxious?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, but also lost its anger. From one extreme to another."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It makes you feel like you're losing some kind of energy, doesn't it?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "In a way, the state of affairs is a numbness, no passion or motivation."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You think the state is more numb than the peace in the heart, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, calm and numbness are different, and I'm more of a number."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I see. So, is there anything that interests you or has ever been, that ever made you feel very committed and dynamic?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "There are many. My painting dream, for example, was long held up, but then put aside, just because of the pressure of reality."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, I can hear your share of your insistence on dreams, but I can feel the impact of real stress."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I always felt that reality and dreams were impossible to reconcile, and that I had chosen to give up my dreams, which had also led me to lose myself more and more."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, it sounds like you're trying to be happy inside, but it seems difficult to balance these two at this stage."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, I tried a lot of things that people thought were funny, but I ended up feeling empty."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "In that case, do you think these things don't really touch your inner needs?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it's like entering an emotional vacuum, being isolated from the outside world, and not feeling it."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I hear it here. I wonder, is this a feeling of emotional isolation?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it's like entering an emotional vacuum, being isolated from the outside world, and not feeling it."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I noticed that your nickname is self-serving, and if you want, we could come together and talk about some professional ideas that might help you."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Okay, no problem. I'm willing to listen to professional advice."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, okay. So let's slow down and explore if you feel that there's some emotion or memory that's being ignored in your subconscious?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I sometimes feel that my memory is full of blanks and that the feelings that I can't face may be held back by me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "What does it feel like to have a memory?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "This sense of drift is primarily about the last year or two, and I seem to have lost my feelings and memories of a lot of things."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You mentioned that the memory and emotion of the last year or two had this sense of suspense. Can you say a little more?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, sometimes looking back at the past, it's like a dream, it's vague."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like a vague and illusory experience, like in a dream. How does it feel?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Indeed, I feel that I am isolated from real life, as a bystander, and cannot really participate in it."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "This isolation and bystanding state may make you feel like you're not really living at the moment, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, the lack of emotion and isolation make me feel particularly painful but cannot change."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand how painful you are in this situation. It must be very troubling to face it. What factors do you think make you particularly uncomfortable? Anything else you want to share?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I think today's conversation has been very helpful to me, and I want to continue."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "What time is it easier for you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I'm free on weekends."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sorry, we don't have a consultation on weekends.

Can you tell me what you felt under pressure when you were in high school?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It's mainly about learning pressure and schoolmate relationships."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Learning and relationships are very difficult to find."}, {"role": "user", "text": "There is no particular specific approach, but there are some ideas."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It sounds like you've been a hard time.

Can you tell me what's bothering you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I'm not too bold to speak in my class and afraid to talk to others."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand. It makes you nervous to speak and talk in class, doesn't it?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it's like crying in a way that can't be controlled, sometimes I can't even say why."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You sound very upset at all these moments. What do you think this could have to do with anything?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It's probably because of the pressure and the sense of loneliness that I'm feeling, or I don't know why."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Understand, it is really hard to feel alone and stressful, and wonder if there are friends, relatives or others who can talk to you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "No one is particularly close to me, so they'll bother me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It's a difficult situation. When you're unhappy or under stress, what do you usually do to reconcile your emotions?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Usually, you can watch funny videos or listen to music and try to distract yourself."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Okay, that's a good way to ease the mood. Have you ever been to a hospital or other psychological platform before?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Not before, this is the first time you've been looking for a psychological consultation."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, if it feels bad, I suggest that we go to a local hospital or a aid agency and get professional help. If it's a little less emotional, we can talk about it and be emotional and accompanying."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Okay, thank you."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand that this is a really difficult process for you."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I really appreciate you listening to me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I also note your reference to positive changes in universities since high school, although the process remains difficult."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Well, there's been some change, feeling a little better."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "The situation had improved somewhat compared to the high school, which was a very positive step."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, it's still a bit more emotional than it was before."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, in general, we all have bad feelings or fears of speaking."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Well, I know sometimes it's normal, but sometimes it's not controlful."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "But it's better to have someone who listens to us. Or has a more effective way of emotional guidance. It's definitely uncomfortable to hold it."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, I always feel like I'm holding it in my heart."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Especially when we have difficulty, it becomes more obvious. Who is the most likely to hear your business and to ease your emotions among the people you know?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I don't want my parents to know."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Oh, I understand. In this case, it is really important to find someone who can trust and talk. Have you tried other ways of emotional orientation, such as writing a diary or participating in some relaxed activities?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, sometimes I feel a little better saying it."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, it does make it easier for you to say it. Relations with parents are also an important support system, although it may not be appropriate to speak directly, but it is also important to keep in touch. How are your regular communication with parents?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It's okay, but they're looking forward to it."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, can we talk to them?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Not really. They always think I should be the one to adjust my emotions and not understand how I feel."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, why is this?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Maybe they didn't know that psychological problems, and they thought I should be stronger."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, I understand.

I wish someone could hear me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I'll always listen to you here."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Well, it reassures me a little."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "And thank you for your trust in me."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Thank you. I think it'll be easier to talk to you."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I am glad you think so. If you want, we can arrange a regular exchange of time, which may be of greater help to you."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, I do."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "What time do you think it would be easier to meet every week? For example, we meet every week at regular intervals so we can make progress more sustainable."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Okay, Thursday night, 8:00 is perfect for me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, we meet every Thursday at 8 p.m. We can summarize some of the problems you are currently mentioning. You mention that from junior high school and high school to college, you have problems of lack of confidence, stress, stress, relationships, emotional problems, especially at night. Which aspects do you find most disturbing?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Unconfidence and fear have affected many of my aspects."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You see, these two questions are a major problem for you, especially in the context of schoolmate relationships.

Do you want to try something?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Maybe it takes a little courage and action. Not just a thought."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Yes, focusing on oneself may help to increase self-worth and reduce the impact of external evaluation by working to raise it."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Well, I think you're right. I should focus more on myself than on what others think."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Yeah, that's a good idea."}, {"role": "user", "text": "However, there was some uncertainty about how to do that, and more discussion might be needed."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Okay, so let's talk about it together. What do you think is the specific way to help you raise yourself?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It may be that specific directions are found, such as learning and personal preferences, to promote themselves."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you've got some good ideas. We're going back to the issue of intimate relationships. You want to find someone who really suits you at your own pace, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I hope to find someone who really fits me, not one who has been hasty to get out of isolation."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "In practice, the purpose of the consultation is to help you find a solution to the problem, and the consultant does not usually give specific guidance to visitors directly."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I understand that I also hope that I can find the answer myself, which would make more sense."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "What kind of person do you think is really your type?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I think he should be someone who understands me, has a common interest and is truly good to me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Mm-hmm.
