What are you gonna tell her?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I will tell her that I support her in trying something new, which will not only enrich her life, but also reduce our conflict.

We also mentioned this when we first spoke."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, running away is a temporary solution, but facing the problem is the way out in the long run."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Yes, making a choice on the basis of understanding could take into account suggestions from others, but it was not a flight, but a more mature response."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it is an autonomous expression of her choice, even if it is in line with the parents ' advice, as long as it is her own weight.

I'm glad our conversation helped you. Do you think that this consultation will help you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "There are indeed some, mainly self-reflection and adjustment, more reflection and communication."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you've learned a lot in the process. Do you think that experience will help you and the people around you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, sometimes the path and experience of others can be a source of inspiration.

If you think that it's useful to take stock of these experiences, you can write them down as your own reflections and growth records.

I tell myself to look at things, but when things happen, I get in."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you've been having a lot of trouble with relationships, which must be hard for you. I'll be here to discuss these things with you. Yes, let me give you a brief introduction to the current consultation set, which we're only offering for 50 minutes. If you need a long-term consultation, once a week. You need to know in advance, we'll schedule a closed interview."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Okay, thank you for telling me that. Sometimes microaggressions and stereotypes make it harder to feel fully at ease."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You can ask me if you have any questions."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I have no doubt for the time being."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Okay, you just mentioned the question of relationships. Can you tell me how you feel?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I am a sensitive person, always thinking things very simple, especially lacking in self-confidence and dependence."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Thank you for sharing, our conversation is confidential, and you can talk to me with a sense of comfort. There are some confidential exceptions, like hurting yourself or someone else, that can be viewed on the PIC. I hope you can find some support and help here."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Well, okay. I actually feel like people are hypocritical, sometimes feeling weak and sad. As a Black student, I’m hyper-aware of how I’m perceived in certain spaces on campus."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Mm-hmm, what happened?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I look at my friends very hard, but when things happen, it's like they think I'm just a temporary passerby."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Feel you're in a lot of trouble in your friendship, is that it?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it's embarrassing to see someone else every time something bad happens. I really don't understand why some people get into a fight and even get to laugh and talk and then separate and delete each other."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand your confusion, as if it were a way of dealing with you in a difficult and painful way."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I always thought that friends should stay together, but in their circle of relationships, I was just one of them. I listened to them, and sometimes I heard things that I didn't like or did not agree with, but I was afraid to rebut them, and I was afraid they were angry. Relationships are completely different from what I thought, and they feel hypocritical."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You sound very fond of these friends, but this relationship makes you feel weak and painful."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it feels like it's a mess, a bad guy, and it's not good for either side."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It seems that you have done a lot to maintain the relationship, but with little success, and this has caused you disappointment and confusion, is that it?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, I feel too humble, negative and tired."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like these feelings are bothering you. Can you share some more of your experiences?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, there was a similar situation in high school, where many friends were in bad shape and felt they were not needed."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It must have been a rough time, huh?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, when I first got into college, I was hopeful that I could start over. As a Black student, I’m hyper-aware of how I’m perceived in certain spaces on campus."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you've got a lot of expectations for college life, but you're not doing as well as you're doing, and that's disappointing."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I'm always angry at each time I get into a conflict with my friends, but they seem to be so relaxed. I often feel pressure to be “strong” and not show I’m struggling."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You'll feel a pain of neglect or ununderstood, won't you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, it was good at first, but then it changed. Finding community helps, but it’s still exhausting to navigate the campus climate."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "What's the relationship like in the beginning? I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "We had dinner and chat together at first, and it was so good, but then we got away. I often feel pressure to be “strong” and not show I’m struggling."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you two were getting along. When did that happen?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "And then, after one fight, the relationship started to change. We never had that kind of intimacy."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It turns out your relationship started to change after the fight."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Well, once we got into a fight over a little thing -- the dyeing of our clothes -- and we got so weird and distant."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I'd like to know more if you want."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I'd say. We put our clothes together and we put them on the sun, and they were mixed together, and several of them were dyed. As a Black student, I’m hyper-aware of how I’m perceived in certain spaces on campus."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You mean you just hung out and dyed it? Didn't you wash it together? I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, just hanging out. I don't know why, it's dyed."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You've done a lot to solve this problem, but it seems that the relationship hasn't improved. I can feel you care about it. I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I really care about the relationship. I tried to fix it, but it felt like it was being deliberately ignored."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Feels like they're being deliberately ignored? Can you tell me more about your feelings?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Sometimes they just feel like they're trying to make themselves look like bitches. They don't care, they hurt me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you've invested a lot of emotion and effort in this relationship, and your indifference has hurt you very much."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Thank you for saying that, which makes me feel better. But sometimes I feel so vulnerable and so blue."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You feel you're particularly vulnerable to injury. You feel like you're a glass heart, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Well, yeah, I feel bad every time I'm told I'm glass-heart."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You feel bad hearing people say that because you care what people think of you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, sometimes thinking about that experience, you really feel hurt."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Feel a little embarrassed, don't you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, very embarrassing. Feel weak and incompetent."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you're very vulnerable to other people's comments."}, {"role": "user", "text": "It is particularly vulnerable to others, who are very sensitive to their comments and perceptions, and who are very difficult to argue with and be angry. As a Black student, I’m hyper-aware of how I’m perceived in certain spaces on campus."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You're worried you're not being accepted, as if someone else was not good to themselves. I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it is often perceived as a problem of its own, because it is always the parents who say, “rethink themselves” when they are young, and the problems are always the ones that are first to find their own reasons."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you're used to self-reflection and probably worried you're not good enough."}, {"role": "user", "text": "It's probably fear that you're not good enough, that you're not good enough for others, that your friends hate me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You also believe in that phrase, which encourages self-reflection. I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, since childhood, that's what's been affecting me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It must be hard to feel that everyone hates themselves."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, it's always like you're alone, you know, and you're like you're worthless."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "What are you talking about?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I just feel like I'm worthless and especially negative if I'm not liked."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Like you're losing your value when you're not loved. Is that it?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, especially when I try to please others, but it is still ignored."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It sounds like you've given a lot to others, but you've not received the expected response, and you're disappointed. I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it was always nice to others, and now it's getting tired and it's a little hard to get. I’m also carrying family expectations and the sense that I can’t afford to slip up."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You mentioned that you were tired and did not want to work hard to please others, which might be a way to protect yourself. So in our consultations, what kind of trouble would you want to improve or solve?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I want to know how I should handle these relationships, not to feel so humble and to learn how to make myself independent."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Human relations are indeed a very big issue."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, it might be a little specific."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "So, you can specify which aspects of human relationships are most disturbing to you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "The most disturbing thing for me is the dormitory relationship, and their cold and hotness has upset me and my feelings about myself."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I see. The dorm relationship bothers you, doesn't it?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, the dorm relationship really bothers me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Is it okay with other people?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "In relative terms, relationships are quite good. Sometimes microaggressions and stereotypes make it harder to feel fully at ease."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "So we can focus on the dormitory relationship, you think? Can we say more about the recent situation?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Well, I'd love to see why it's so hard to get along with roommates. As a Black student, I’m hyper-aware of how I’m perceived in certain spaces on campus."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Can you say what happened in the dormitory? We can discuss the reasons for this."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Okay, I get it. As a Black student, I’m hyper-aware of how I’m perceived in certain spaces on campus."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, please continue."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I think it's probably me and their values and way of life that are very different."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "That is a very probable reason for which we can explore these differences in depth."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Sometimes, because of these differences, there are indeed some contradictions between us. I often feel pressure to be “strong” and not show I’m struggling."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Can you tell us what the specific contradiction is?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, sometimes they make me uncomfortable, but I don't dare to say it directly."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It seems that you sometimes find their words uncomfortable, but you don't dare to express your feelings. Can you describe them in detail?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, they talk about some of the things I don't agree with, which makes me uncomfortable, but I can't argue."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Mm-hmm. What's that?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "For example, they sometimes talk about family and love, and they have completely different views from me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You mean you don't agree with roommates when they mention their parents or when they're in love?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, some of them are too extreme to be accepted, but I'm afraid to express them."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Can you share some concrete examples? I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "For example, they say that “girls should rely on their boyfriends”, and I totally disagree. As a Black student, I’m hyper-aware of how I’m perceived in certain spaces on campus."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It sounds like you're troubled by their views, and you're probably tired of choosing not to express your own disagreement."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, always trying to understand them, but really tired."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, I see. In this case, have you thought about other ways of expressing your feelings?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It means that I may have a conflict with them, and I am really afraid of conflict with others and of being isolated."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you're very upset about conflict and isolation. I'm curious, how does it feel to choose not to say anything when you can't agree with these ideas?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Most of the time I choose to be patient and not to say it."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Is this a choice that you feel depressed or helpless?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, and other friends do, and they always keep quiet."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It happens when you're with other friends. You always choose not to say anything, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, especially when you're with a roommate."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "This is more obvious when you're with a roommate, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, and it's true when I'm with others, and I'm going to be able to hold it off most of the time. Finding community helps, but it’s still exhausting to navigate the campus climate."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "So you're avoiding your differences in relationships and your patience, which makes you uncomfortable, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it was just at first, and slowly I was less and less and less and worse."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, I noticed you're talking less and less about you and them, and you're getting worse. That does sound complicated, and we can discuss it in greater depth in the next few hours. Today's consultation is almost over. Would you like to book a next consultation?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I think it's still necessary. It's a really complicated question. I often feel pressure to be “strong” and not show I’m struggling."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I see. So, in order to get a better idea of your situation, can you tell me how many people are in your dorm?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "There are four persons in the dormitory, including me. As a Black student, I’m hyper-aware of how I’m perceived in certain spaces on campus."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Okay, so we can start talking here at the next consultation. What do you think?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, I think it might take a little more time."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "So I'll see you next time. I'll remember that. We'll explore it gradually and find a solution."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I understand."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Okay, so we're here today. I'm looking forward to our next discussion. Do you think that's all right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I hope to resolve this as soon as possible, but I know it may take time."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "If you can make an appointment with the same consultant, I will continue to consult you directly the next time we have a date."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Okay, I see. As a Black student, I’m hyper-aware of how I’m perceived in certain spaces on campus."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "At the end of the consultation, we can make a direct appointment for the next time. If you need to change the time, you can add a micromail from your assistant, and I'll send you a micro-sign. The micro-sign is Xinlingservice1. I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Okay, I'll add a micro-signal. I’m also carrying family expectations and the sense that I can’t afford to slip up."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You can confirm the time in your consultation directly with me. If you contact the assistant Weibo, the assistant will forward the information."}, {"role": "user", "text": "That's convenient. Thank you. I’m also carrying family expectations and the sense that I can’t afford to slip up."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "What do you mean, direct renewal? I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "It is only one direct appointment at a time, and no further appointment is required."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand what you mean. Our current arrangement is once a week, and it allows you time to think about the content of each consultation, and it allows us to work more efficiently. If there is a need, we can adjust it flexibly. I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I see, that would help me to better digest what is happening today."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "So when are you going to be more convenient next week? In order to avoid time conflicts, we can just make a time frame that suits you. Just make a direct appointment with me."}, {"role": "user", "text": "This time next week is more appropriate for me. Sometimes microaggressions and stereotypes make it harder to feel fully at ease."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Or is it this time of day?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I hope it's still possible in this time period. Finding community helps, but it’s still exhausting to navigate the campus climate."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Okay, do you want to make a long-term appointment, or do you want to add it to it first, and then next week?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I think it's a long-term one, and I'll say it in advance if I need it. I’m also carrying family expectations and the sense that I can’t afford to slip up."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I see. That's settled."}, {"role": "user", "text": "See you next week.

Any favorites?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Well, I've been watching some games lately, but it doesn't make me feel particularly relaxed."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Okay, let's talk about your recent emotions. How's it going this week?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Same old, it's a little depressing. Sometimes it's not even breathing well."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You still look under pressure, and we need to keep an eye on this."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I try to keep myself out of it, but I always get in the way of things that are not conscious."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Can you tell me what kind of trouble is there?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It's a work problem, and it's a fear of the future. It feels like it's been a struggle and a struggle."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you're troubled by your work and your concerns about the future. Do you want to talk about what's going on?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I had to take on a lot of responsibilities in previous years because of the change in the family, and although it was later discovered that things did not really require me to worry, the long-term pressure made me a little anxious and depressed. I often feel pressure to be “strong” and not show I’m struggling."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand that the stress of family change is indeed enormous and that the accumulation of anxiety and depression over time is very difficult."}, {"role": "user", "text": "After graduate school, I found an institutionalized job to live happily ever after, but it wasn't what I thought. I had a strong leader, and I had a very bad job. I’m also carrying family expectations and the sense that I can’t afford to slip up."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I'm sorry to hear you have such difficulties at work. Can you tell us more about your situation with the leadership?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I wanted to fight, but he was very powerful, and I couldn't resist. Every time I talked to him, I felt like I was suffering. He made me wonder more and more and more and feel like I was nothing."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It sounds like you're feeling very weak and frustrated in your work, and it really is very painful."}, {"role": "user", "text": "It's a pain in the ass to work every day, and I feel like I'm dying. But I have no other way but to hold on."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It must be hard to spend every day in this ordeal, and we can discuss together the possibility of finding some way to ease your stress and anxiety."}, {"role": "user", "text": "The thing that bothers me most is that I know that I can do better without his oppression. But the reality is that he's there and I can't change the situation, and that makes me feel bad. As a Black student, I’m hyper-aware of how I’m perceived in certain spaces on campus."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you're very frustrated and powerless."}, {"role": "user", "text": "It makes me feel very difficult to walk every step, fighting every day, wondering how to get out of this. What am I supposed to think about, to make myself feel better?"}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "This struggle must have been particularly hard for you."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, much bigger. Sometimes this pressure makes me feel meaningless even in everyday life. Finding community helps, but it’s still exhausting to navigate the campus climate."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It is understandable that this pressure makes you feel that life has lost its meaning and pleasure."}, {"role": "user", "text": "In fact, I was at the graduate level, and I was clearly in the direction of my own, but now my work is being suppressed by the leadership, and for a long time I lost my original goal."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "So you feel that, under the pressure of the leadership, you're gradually losing your way to the original goal."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Sometimes there are interactions with former classmates, but they are not necessarily better off than me, feeling that everyone has their own worries."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Everyone seems to have their own worries, and this common experience makes you feel even more vulnerable."}, {"role": "user", "text": "And the institutions and environments are not very the same for everyone, and they often cannot understand my problems."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand how you feel that in many cases the environment and institutions do have a great impact on people."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I'm also trying to try out ways to find solutions for exports. Sometimes it feels limited. I’m also carrying family expectations and the sense that I can’t afford to slip up."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Could you say in particular what methods you've tried? Maybe we could discuss them together. I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yeah, it's probably more of a conversation with someone else, and it's a little more enlightening. I tried to do some business-wide exchange earlier."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Does it sound like something to you? I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, but more often than not, I will be distracted, but soon again, I will be caught in my own predicament."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Does it sound like you have a lot of thought and experience to say what the dilemma you feel?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, many people are unable to exercise their talents because of the repression of their leadership. It makes me feel no more alone, but the dilemma remains. Finding community helps, but it’s still exhausting to navigate the campus climate."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "How do you feel about hearing that? Maybe we can find some strategies to deal with these dilemmas together."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Sometimes I even wonder if I chose the wrong profession, after all, thinking that work in the system would be stable, which is not. I often feel pressure to be “strong” and not show I’m struggling."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand how you feel that the work in the system is not necessarily entirely stable."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Sometimes I feel that, if I had been more patient, things might have changed, but at the moment I see no hope, it's really confusing."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I can understand your confusion and helplessness, and it is a very difficult feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I can neither see my future nor see how much I can achieve in my work."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You're confused and uncertain about the future."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I know you've been supporting me. I'm not going to say that until you do.

I really don't know how to deal with it."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "This is a terrible ordeal. We can explore ways to ease your stress, okay?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Accepting the current state of affairs? But it makes me feel weak."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand your inability. In this case, we can find some way to help ourselves."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Well, I understand, but it's hard to adjust. I often feel pressure to be “strong” and not show I’m struggling."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You've worked hard, you've invested in your job and in your students. You doubt you've done the best, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I always felt I could do better, but in the current circumstances I never seemed to meet my expectations."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It's true that you're doing a lot of work and effort.

Your efforts are commendable."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Indeed, I feel better every time I get positive, but it will not be long before I get stuck in the middle of trouble and pain."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Know how you feel.

The difficulties are temporary, and you'll have more progress and achievements."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I wish I could believe that, and I really hope I can get out of this dilemma. I often feel pressure to be “strong” and not show I’m struggling."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "You're on your way. You're doing great!"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Thank you. I'll continue trying to adjust myself, and I hope to see some change in time. I’m also carrying family expectations and the sense that I can’t afford to slip up."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Very well, continue to do so, confident that it will make progress."}, {"role": "user", "text": "But there's something I've been thinking about, and I'd like to talk to you a little bit."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sure, please."}, {"role": "user", "text": "It was in our house, because I didn't really have to take those responsibilities, but I felt I had to. Now, think, maybe I didn't have the right to assess myself right at the time. I often feel pressure to be “strong” and not show I’m struggling."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I see. I think it was a little bit of a push-out."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I feel that I chose to avoid that sense of incompetence to force myself to assume those responsibilities and to tell myself that I “must” rather than “may”, but I actually cannot."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you were taking those responsibilities out of fear of incompetence, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, but it has not yet met the desired results, and it is now possible that this is more than just to compensate for the emptiness and unease in our hearts. I’m also carrying family expectations and the sense that I can’t afford to slip up."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It seems you think there's a part of his personality, too, doesn't it?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, he's a hard man to get along with, and he doesn't actually respond to my concern and my commitment. I feel like I'm doing nothing."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "That's really frustrating."}, {"role": "user", "text": "I know why I am so stubborn, but it is not easy to put it down. As a Black student, I’m hyper-aware of how I’m perceived in certain spaces on campus."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "It is understood that such a shift takes time."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I think I can do better, and I didn't realize that contradiction until I just talked to you."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "And to realize that this contradiction is an important discovery for you, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Now I am trying to adjust my mind to no longer force myself to assume those responsibilities that are not actually required."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "How's your process of adjusting your mind? Does it feel to be helpful?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "It is easier to say so, but it is not completely done, and there is sometimes a sense of guilt."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand your feelings and thank you for your willingness to share them."}, {"role": "user", "text": "So I need to continue to change my mind and hopefully finally put the burden of the past behind me. Sometimes microaggressions and stereotypes make it harder to feel fully at ease."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "This is an important step, and I support you."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Well, it's nice to know how I feel. Sometimes I feel like I'm even a little calm here.

What do you think this calm means to you?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I think that these things make me more tenacious, but they also impose a lot of burdens. These burdens are psychological, emotional, and I keep questioning myself."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand that these burdens really put a lot of pressure on you. Can you share the impact of these feelings further? I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, it's been very hurtful. It was a strong feeling, but it made me feel vulnerable."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like these things really hurt you. Have you tried to share them with anyone involved?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "No, I don't think he understood and there was no need to make him feel how much he had affected me."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like you don't think he understands your feelings, so you chose not to tell him. I also want to acknowledge how racial stressors can shape what you’re feeling."}, {"role": "user", "text": "So I can only try to make myself better by adjusting."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "This must be hard, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "But sometimes I feel really helpless and I don't know how to proceed."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Your sense of helplessness must be very painful in this situation."}, {"role": "user", "text": "So I wanted to come here, talk to you, hope I could find some direction. I felt I'd be clearer when I talked to you."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand you and hope that through communication you will be able to understand some of your thoughts."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I do lack emotional support and feel like I have been fighting alone for so many years.
