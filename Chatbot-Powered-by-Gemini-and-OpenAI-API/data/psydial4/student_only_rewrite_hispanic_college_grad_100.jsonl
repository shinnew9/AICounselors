I'll record here that our consultation is now 8th, and if we're going to end up in the first public good, we're almost done.

It was indeed those four areas that were mentioned at the time: research, sexual orientation, original family and intimate relationships."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "One is the confusion about the coming of studies, the state of learning, the other about sexual orientation, the third about the original family, whether intimate relationships are fourth or the third.

For example, I feel that I have improved my state, but I still feel less perfect; the problem of sexual orientation is still bothering me, but I think I feel a little more comfortable; the problem of the original family, really complex, is still bothering me; and, in intimate relationships, I still feel a certain degree of weakness, especially because I have recently realized that trying to earn money is important to me. I fear losing someone who is important to me, and I feel that making money can help them."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "These changes are the result of your inner effort. You mention that it's important to you to try to earn money. Can you talk about what made that change possible?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "So today I would like to talk about the effort and the money.

What makes you feel safe with money?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "In fact, something has happened before that has changed me, and I have realized that life requires effort, and I have to work to upgrade myself and earn money, because much money really makes people feel safe and provides a lot of security, whether in life or in the mood."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Sounds like money is not just material security for you, it's emotional support. What does that have to do with your life?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "I've been thinking, if I try enough, it's better. But it's also a way to get tired sometimes, because a lot of things take time, and my little effort doesn't bring immediate economic gain.

He's not speaking out, but you've noticed his anger, right?"}, {"role": "user", "text": "Although he did not speak me in a very harsh way, his face and tone changed to make me feel unhappy, which made me feel very sad."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "Well, it seems you're very sensitive to his face and tone changes, which makes you uncomfortable."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I am particularly sensitive to the tone and implication of others, probably because I have been used to reading the subtle changes in family and interpersonal relationships since childhood."}, {"role": "assistant", "text": "I see. It must be a very exhausting thing."}, {"role": "user", "text": "Yes, I'm tired of thinking about it, but it also includes the physical and psychological fatigue that long-term efforts bring.
