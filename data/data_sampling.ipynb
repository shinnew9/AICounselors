            "\n",
            "[user] The main thing is that there are fewer people around me who can talk. Many of my friends who were able to speak before are busy and meet less often. I feel isolated.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand that this isolation is really hard. Did you help with the drug adjustment you mentioned earlier?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, recently the doctor added me a drug, and at first it started, the heart rate was clearly accelerating, and the whole person was very excited, but it wasn't good, emotional or physical.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like the side effects of this drug are quite important to you, and you might need to get back to your doctor. You just mentioned a lack of communication channels. Can you tell us what problems have been encountered in this area?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I have hardly anyone else but my family to really talk about. Especially those friends who were close, they're almost all very few.\n",

            "[assistant] What's that got to do with you?\n",

            "[assistant] Since when do you feel so alone?\n",
            "\n",

            "[assistant] I see. So, what's the change in the feeling after having a baby?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] This feeling becomes stronger when you have a child. It was not as obvious as it was when you said before, but it was more so when you were born, especially when my wife's focus shifted to the child.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You said that once the wife's focus was on the child, could you tell me how it made you feel?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, she's got almost all the time and energy on her kids now, and I rarely have the chance to talk to her in depth. It makes me feel like we're getting distant.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Mm-hmm. What do you think of your wife's change after the baby's birth?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] She gets busy, she gets tired, she gets unstable. Especially when a child gets sick or has problems, she gets nervous and nervous. I want to help, but I feel like I'm not doing enough.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It sounds like she's under a lot of pressure. What does that have to do with you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] And the change for me is that I'm becoming more introverted and silent and less willing to share my feelings with others. The feeling of loneliness inside is getting stronger and stronger, as if I could not find someone who really understands me.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, that makes you feel bad, doesn't it?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Don't want to face things that make me feel pain and weakness. I don't want to go into it, either because of family conflict or my sense of loneliness. Sometimes I think running away is the best option.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand. So do you think these feelings became more obvious after the baby was born?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, we had a lot of intimate time before, but the baby just came along and broke that balance. I felt like I had lost a significant part of it and I was not comfortable with it.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand that this change will indeed pose a number of challenges. Today we have almost enough time for consultations. Can we continue next Wednesday at 9:00?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] It's probably not easy next Wednesday. There's some things to do. Can I talk to you about it later?\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Okay, well, we don't have a specific time, so you can call me when you can. So here's the consultation today, thank you for sharing and trust. See you next time. Good night.\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",
            "[user] The reason why it's not specific is that the whole person suddenly loses interest in life and feels like doing nothing. And nothing really big happened at that time.\n",

But if you have other questions or places to discuss, we can continue to talk about your psychological adjustment methods and the challenges that we face.\n",
            "\n",

            "[assistant] I am better at CBT, humanism and ACT.\n",

            "[assistant] Do you think there's anything special about these therapies?\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "[assistant] Um, can you say what this means to you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Because if you choose a way that is not for you, it can be a waste of time and energy. And emotional things can get harder and harder to solve.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You mentioned that it might be better to think that CBT was working.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I've studied it myself before. The CBT is effective for a lot of people and operational.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Could you tell me more about the CBT's appeal to you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] It is to be able to feel that your emotions are stable and to think rationally, not emotional responses.\n",

            "\n",
            "[user] It is primarily to help me control this seasonal depression, which allows me to remain in normal working and living conditions in winter.\n",

            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, it would be one hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon, or it would be gradually increased according to its ability.\n",

            "[user] Yes, I really feel helpless. I know she's doing it for my own good, but it makes me feel like I'm being controlled. If I don't do what she says, she'll say that I am the one who's going to be responsible for it, like I'm threatening.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like your mother's concern for you is a little bit stressful. You think that these words sometimes make you feel threatened, don't you?\n",

            "[user] I told her many times that I could make my own decisions and promised that she would not be responsible if there were any problems in the future. But she always answered me with a tough attitude, saying that I would never ask her again. That makes me feel redundant and helpless.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You want to be able to make your own decisions and she wants to understand and support your choices. But her hard-line attitude makes you feel helpless and isolated, right?\n",

            "[user] Yes.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand how you feel. Each of us wants to live our lives as we wish, and sometimes it's not terrible to face uncertainty. Are you willing to explore how to better communicate with her and express your feelings and needs?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I do, and I understand that. But she doesn't think that she always feels that I have to do it her way, or she's not responsible for herself. She even kidnaps me with morality, and I don't know how to be grateful, and so on.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "[assistant] This may make you feel even more guilty. I remember you mentioned earlier that you weren't home, and you missed your parents. Every time this conflict happens, your emotions are complicated.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I do miss them, but I really feel so bad about this. I feel so troubled every time I talk to her, I want to obey her, I don't want to lose myself.\n",

            "[assistant] I understand the complex feelings and pains you feel.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I think the most painful thing is that I lost control, that my life was in her hands, and she took it for granted. Let me feel that I have no independent rights and space.\n",

            "[assistant] What do you think losing control of your life means to you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] For me, ownership means freedom, independence and responsibility for my own life. I want to make decisions, take consequences, not be controlled. But at Mom's, I'm never gonna be able to get away with her intervention.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand, you want more freedom and independence, right? How do you usually feel about Mom's intervention?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I hope she respects my decision, not always controlling me. But she always treats me the way she feels right, which is very depressing to me.\n",

            "[assistant] Well, it does sound stressful. What do you think she might have done to you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] She may think I'm not listening to her advice as if I were ignorant and disrespectful. She thinks her experience and choices are the best and she cannot accept my different ideas and approaches.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] These are the reactions that parents do have. So, what do you feel when you disagree with her?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I'd feel guilty and feel like I'm hitting her, but I'm depressed because I can't live as I want. It's a very strange and painful feeling.\n",

            "[assistant] The combination of these two feelings is really painful. Where do you think they come from?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I think that these feelings are the result of her control and the conflict between my resistance. Her strength is depressing me, and my resistance is making me feel guilty. I feel so bad when I combine these two feelings.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like you've been through a lot of complex emotional conflicts in this process. It's a really tough process, isn't it?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Indeed, I feel that I've been struggling to find a balance between her expectations and my thoughts. It's confusing to me, not knowing how to adjust my relationship with her.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I can feel your confusion. It's really hard to struggle. Can you tell me more about your feelings?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I also feel that I need to be clear about my heart so that I can face her more firmly and tell her what I really think and feel.\n",

            "[assistant] It's a really important step for you to realize that you're getting a better sense of yourself.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I agree that I need to learn more about and identify my needs and feelings in order to communicate with her more thoroughly. I hope that this will ease our conflict.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Yes, it is very important to know what your needs and feelings are. Your relationship seems important, and perhaps you can find a way to express it easily.\n",

            "[user] Well, I'll try to find a suitable time to calmly talk to her about my feelings and ideas, to hope that she understands me and that we can find a better way to get along.\n",

            "[assistant] It's a very good strategy. She's gonna be interested in knowing how you feel, and it'll help you.\n",

            "[assistant] I understand your concerns, and that's not easy. But you've done a great deal to give yourself some time and space, and you'll find a better way to get along.\n",

            "[assistant] You mean you're walking around like you're resting. You don't have to do papers or anything interesting, you just leave it empty.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, totally empty, nothing. Just a moment of freedom.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like a pretty good way to make you feel like this. Do you do that often?\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, sounds like a nice way to adjust. Do you have any other way to relax yourself than sneaking around?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Sometimes I play badminton, I feel better about sports, and I talk to friends.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] So, does it help you feel like you're writing papers when you play ball and chat?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, after playing or talking, you're gonna feel a little relaxed and not so depressed when you write papers.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I see, these methods are very helpful to you. Have you been showing a tendency to increase your pressure lately?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] No doctor has been visited, because it is a psychological problem and it is hoped that it will be regulated.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, you mean you just got a physical checkup, but you didn't do any more tests or therapy.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, I just had a medical examination that showed signs of acetone, but no further treatment.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It is clear that intervention from the physical aspect may be more effective if the mood fluctuations are caused by acetylene. It is suggested that you could consider further medical examinations to determine whether treatment is needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I understand that there may be a need to check again to see if treatment is needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Yes, it would be helpful if some further checks were not made at the present time.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Okay, I'll think about it.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You can try to increase your movement, which is a physiological help to mediate emotions, and which may have a positive effect on your emotions.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Okay, I'll keep on going, I hope.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds good. Feels like you've got some self-regulation options. You're confident you're going to try?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, the support of sports and friends gave me some confidence that I still thought I could adjust.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It sounds like you've got a lot of achievement from it, and it's really great to be better at it.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Indeed, when it did, it was particularly satisfying, as if there were some positive things happening in life.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] So, when you feel successful, you feel especially satisfied, right? Does it feel like it sometimes?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] For example, when doing some creative research or projects, it feels similar and full.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds creative and fills you with satisfaction. Thinking about these happy things makes it easier?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, leaving those troubles for a while would be a bit more comfortable and hopefully more such a moment.\n",

            "[assistant] Well, I understand. Do you think these emotions affect your life, and that's one of the reasons you're here?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I feel like I'm in a mountain car, sometimes happy, but sometimes I cry like a bitch, and I can't lift up for weeks. And I recently lost the ability to sleep when I fell asleep in bed. Forget school. It's torture in the morning.\n",

            "[assistant] I can understand how you feel. Can you remember when these uncomfortable feelings started?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Probably early last year, since then, these problems have become increasingly serious.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand that something special happened to you at the beginning of last year.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I actually had a few particularly hard times at the beginning of last year, and there were family things. Mom was always angry at me, and she didn't know why, and the atmosphere was so depressing.\n",

            "[assistant] These events have had a great impact on you, haven't they?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, it started around that time. I feel so lonely and a little scared.\n",

            "[assistant] Uh, would you like to talk? Or not if you don't want to.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Well, I'll say it. One day early last year, the family came with a lot of relatives and Grandma and Grandpa. Then Mom got an excuse to reprimand me, and I don't know why. And then she started to turn her back on me.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You sound like you've been in a lot of trouble for a while, don't you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, especially scared. Something's coming near me, but I can't say what it is.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand that this must have been very hard for you. Did you have any other support, friends or other family members?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Home is good, but the atmosphere hasn't improved. Every day, it's in a state of tension and anxiety.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] That time, the anxiety lasted a long time. Did you try to make yourself feel better?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] No. I tried to communicate with her, but she kept avoiding talking or playing around. It felt like Mom was acting hostile to me.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Mm-hmm, that sounds confusing and sad to you.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I asked, but Mom always avoided the subject. Then she stopped asking, because it was pointless.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand. This sort of evasiveness makes you feel helpless, doesn't it?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Maybe because I think I can't change anything even if I know why. She seems to be no longer concerned about me.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It's hard to feel weak, like it's not going to change the situation, and that's gonna be hard for you.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I think she still cares about me. She's changed her attitude towards me since my brother was born and she doesn't care about me anymore.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, this change makes you feel neglected. How old is your brother now?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] My brother is almost eight years old this year.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] According to you, after your brother was born, your mother's attitude towards you started to change, right?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, she's been focusing on him since he was born.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Mm-hmm.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I was so lonely that I couldn't find anyone to talk to and felt like I had been abandoned by my family.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like you're feeling a lot of loneliness and neglect. Can you tell me more about the time?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] About a year ago, from the beginning of last year until now, Mom and I had hardly any conversation.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] This lasts a long time. Can you describe this state of almost no communication?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I don't usually say anything, I don't want to argue with her. It's a waste of time.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Does it sound like you're having trouble communicating, and this is getting you tired?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] She said she took me to the tour, and then she took me to school. The deal never came true.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You're disappointed that this commitment has not been fulfilled, are you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, every time it was verbally agreed, but never actually acted.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Can you say exactly what she mentioned on the phone with the doctor?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] She called the psychiatrist, said I was always emotional, not listening, and said I was acting weird.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Oh, I see. So, she promised to take you to play, but she didn't actually take you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, that's it.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You decided not to go to school.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, and then he was upset and then he stopped going to school.\n",

            "[assistant] How long have you been in this situation?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] It's been about a month, nobody cares.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Looks like you guys are a little nervous. So you're staying at Grandpa's and Grandma's?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, right now, you're staying at Grand-Grandma's.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Will you see Mom this month?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, she comes every day.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] What frequency is it?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] She comes every day.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Every day.\n",

            "[user] Yes, every day.\n",

            "[assistant] Mm-hmm. This is how it's been this month?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, not a day.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like Mom cares about you. How are you guys doing?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, I'm blocking my ears. She's still yelling outside my room. I can't hear you.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Why do you think she's doing this?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I don't know. She probably thinks it's her duty.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] This may make you feel helpless.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] But it doesn't make me like her, but it's getting more and more annoying. I hope she doesn't come.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] These feelings are getting to you.\n",
            "\n",

            "[assistant] What's the problem with you every day?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Usually around 6 p.m.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Oh, I understand. So you'll feel lonely at other times?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I wouldn't be happy if I didn't see her. My heart is empty.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I can feel your emptyness. I can't see how much she's going to lose, can I?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I don't know, I feel like I've lost a lot and I've always had a hole in my heart.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] This loss and the hollowing of the ground is a very sad experience for you. Have you ever tried to find some meaning to fill this void?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Sometimes I think about why I exist, but I give up quickly because no answer is available.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It's a deep question, and sometimes it's really helpless to think about it. So, does this feeling of loneliness begin at a young age?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Well, from childhood to age, it's getting lonely, helpless, and finally it's what it is.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Since when does this feeling become apparent?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] It started about five or six years ago, and it's slowly building up to the present.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, how do you feel in the dark room?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] In the dark room, I felt isolated from the outside world and felt a sense of security.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You're comfortable at this time?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, it's a little lonely, but it's much more comfortable than facing the outside world.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] What kind of trouble do you feel going to be out there?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Trouble is that I have to deal with the complex relationships outside, which often make me tired.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, I understand. Can you tell me what happened between friends that made you feel pressure?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, there's always misunderstandings and disputes between friends, which is a pressure on me.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] So, what do you feel when this misunderstanding and argument occurs?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] All my friends actually made me feel that way, so I'm avoiding contact.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You're being used, aren't you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, sometimes I think they just want something from me, not really care about me.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Oh, I see. You think friends aren't really treating you seriously, but for personal gain.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] They sometimes show enthusiasm, but they never come to me when they need help, and I understand what they're doing.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] That must have disappointed you and left you alone.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I think that friends should have genuine interaction, mutual understanding and support, not false hypocrisy.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You want real understanding and support among friends, not false interaction.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] But in reality, such friends are rarely found.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It makes you feel bad and helpless, doesn't it?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Most friends are a superficial set of behinds, and I have little real concern for them.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You don't think friends are sincere enough, do you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, it is the desire to be honest and respectful.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] So, these friends you're talking about, you know them at school?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, they're all friends at school.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, do these friends still call?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Not often, since I don't go to school much, there's been less contact.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like you were close once, huh?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] It was, but it is not anymore.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] What changed the relationship between you two?\n",
            "\n",

            "[assistant] Um, uh, have you guys been sharing these days?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I talk sometimes, but I don't feel that way anymore.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, I understand. Did you guys feel any pleasure talking?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Sometimes smiles like before, but they don't last long.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] There's gonna be a smile.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, but that joy was short and then it went back to depression.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, it sounds like this change is hard for you.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I wish I could have been, but the reality is cruel.\n",

            "\n",
            "[user] It's basically a flash, not always, but it comes out when the mood is particularly low.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Did you ever try to hurt yourself? Or did you have a plan?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] No, I just occasionally have that idea, but it never really goes into effect.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Thank you very much for sharing this with me. I understand you have not tried suicide. Our service is to help you through this. If you feel a strong sense of suicide, contact the helpline in time. So today's mood is a little low.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I don't want to go to class when I'm in a bad mood, and I feel like I can't concentrate, so I'm gonna stay home and adjust.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like you've been in a really bad mood lately. Can you tell me more about it? How many years do you study?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I was in first grade, I was just starting to study. I thought I'd be excited, and I found it more stressful than I thought.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand that there are new pressures when you start studying. You're in a college of your own, and it's hard.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Well, it's the college I wanted, and I was lucky to be able to keep it going.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] That's great, but many of our students are under stress when they come to new environments and face new challenges.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] But when we got here, it seemed like we had a lot of shortcomings, and others were very good and very small.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It's a common feeling, especially in such an excellent environment. Can you share with me what the specific pressures and challenges are?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] The main reason is that I have a high demand for myself, and a great strain on my family, and my parents always ask me how I learned, and let me feel their expectations and stress.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Is it because of the friend question? Is it like this before you go to graduate school?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Well, there's a little anxiety before you go to graduate school, but it's not that bad. You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you\n",

            "\n",
            "[user] Probably high school, when the competition was particularly intense, I always felt like people were better than me and started to wonder about myself.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It seems that the change you mentioned occurred in high school, and can you tell me what happened to you at that time?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Perhaps because of the too many criticisms and pressures that were put on during that period, when I felt a little bit of progress, some would point to my shortcomings.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand that criticism and pressure do make you deny yourself in that environment. So, you have experienced a lot of effort and challenges at this stage, and do you remember what you did in the process?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I'm a little bit relieved to hear you say that. Maybe I've been denying myself, ignoring my efforts and abilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Can you share your mentor's opinion on you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] My mentors gave me a good opinion, but I always thought she might just encourage me, not really think I was good.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand your doubts, but the mentor's opinions are also professional and objective, and perhaps you can try to see a positive side in his eyes. Which of these evaluations do you think you really agree with?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Sometimes I do feel that I have some capacity, but I just can't keep thinking that.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It is normal that we all ignore our achievements. But, as you said, you are capable, and these assessments reflect your efforts and progress. Together, we can explore how to better see and recognize these positive aspects.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I know that there may be a lot of things I need to learn and perfect, but sometimes it's hard not to deny myself.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Because we can't always build up a lot of capabilities and go to graduate school, so what graduate studies, maybe the process of graduate studies, is that of letting us go to the underdeveloped. Well, you care about people, you know, about what others say about you.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I've always been very concerned about other people's comments, especially those of family members, which put me under a lot of pressure.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Can you say about your parents? What are they like in your education? What kind of people are they? Maybe you can find the source of why you care about people's opinions. Or, have you ever wondered why you care about others' opinions?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] My parents have always been very strict in educating me, and they always want me to be the best, often compared to the children of others. From childhood to age, they are demanding me, so I've developed a hard-core mentality.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like your parents have high expectations for you, don't they? How do they usually express those expectations?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Most of the time it's authoritarian, they rarely talk to me, they just tell me what to do.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, this way you may find it hard to express your feelings. From childhood to age, how do they respond when you feel sad or helpless?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, they always think I'm being defensive, that I just can't control my emotions and not really understand my feelings.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It must be sad. Perhaps they're more concerned because they themselves are confused about how to support you. So, how do you feel now, do you think they understand?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Perhaps they themselves do not know how to face these problems, but can escape in this way.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, it sounds like you think your parents might have their own problems. Can you tell us more about your family?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I'm the only one who put all their expectations and pressure on me.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand that a single child may indeed take on more expectations and pressures. Are parents often busy working? Or are they able to spend enough time with you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] They were busy working, and I grew up with my grandparents as a kid, and my parents only came back for the weekend.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You spend more time with your grandparents. Who do you think you have the closest relationship to in the family?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I should have been the closest to Grandma, she took care of me most.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You and Grandma are very close. Can you elaborate on your relationship with other family members? Including with parents.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, well, Grandma and Mom have been having a bad relationship, and they often say bad things about each other in front of me.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, Grandma's words may affect you, especially when you're not really self-inflicted, and perhaps in that atmosphere you may become a habit of taking people's comments because Grandma judges her mother in front of you, and Mom in front of you, and she's negative. You've witnessed negative evaluations.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I have lived in such a negative assessment environment since I was a child, and perhaps that is why I am always afraid of being evaluated.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I can understand that feeling. This fear of negative perceptions may not exist in practice, but it's a real feeling for you. We can continue to explore the implications of these ideas for you. Next time we can talk in greater depth.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Okay, I think this is a topic that deserves to be discussed. Thank you.\n",

            "\n",
            "[assistant] Oh, I understand that insomnia is a real bother. If insomnia is serious, it may be necessary to seek help from a doctor. And, if it is difficult to sleep at night, try to keep up during the day, not sleep during the day, so as not to affect sleep at night.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I understand, I'll try to adjust my habits and try not to lie in bed during the day.\n",
            "\n",

            "[user] There are stable jobs and incomes, and there are a few friends who feel good, but these do not seem to fill me up.\n",

            "[assistant] Well, we're still going along. Would you like your job?\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, work makes sense to you, but sometimes it makes you tired. What do you think is missing in life?\n",

            "[assistant] Well, how can I put it?\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "[assistant] All the things you wanted were trauma, when there was no trauma, it was like these needs were getting meaningless, right?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, sometimes I think that the earlier pursuit was more a way of confronting trauma, and it was actually achieved, but I find that the new life goals are vague.\n",

            "[assistant] Without need, it's a situation. But it's like you feel bored or worried about something like that.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, it's healing, like losing your target, getting idle.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It's just boring. Any other emotions?\n",
            "\n",

            "[assistant] I understand that this feeling may be confusing.\n",
            "\n",

            "[assistant] So try to describe what this feeling is, what it means to you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, the feeling of loneliness and ignorance is more obvious.\n",

            "\n",

            "[assistant] Can you tell me more about this feeling?\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "[assistant] Are you trying to explore the philosophical and religious dimensions?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, recently, contacts with some philosophy and religion have begun, and hopefully some answers will be found.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I'm curious. Did you find any new inspiration after you came into contact with philosophy and religion?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Perhaps it is for temporary calm, but perhaps it is a process, a process of constant exploration and adjustment.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, it's very interesting to feel like you're constantly looking for answers inside.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Maybe there's more I don't find, and it needs to be done slowly.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Psychology can indeed help us to repair ourselves, but we can also explore it further with knowledge and experience in other areas.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, this may be a limitation of psychology, requiring a combination of more disciplines and experiences.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] The world is changing, as is our inner sense, and it is indeed a critical ability to adapt to change.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, the world is changing, and the human heart is changing, and it may be that adapting to change is the key.\n",

            "[assistant] Mm-hmm, that's it?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] It is hoped that this consultation will provide some new inspiration.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You just mentioned that self-loathing trauma, which has made it worth healing, can create more. Do you have a different view of it? It's nice to talk to you, and I'm interested.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I think that the value of self-repair is no longer based on proof of itself, but rather on more intrinsic meaning, which is different from the previous quest.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It's an interesting point. Can you elaborate on that?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, it's become so light that it doesn't have the same passion and passion as it used to be.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] How do you feel about getting yourself rich?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Something inherently, truly meaningful, may need to be found, rather than relying on outside proof.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, understand. Does this calm bring some sense of loss?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, it's all in the eye, but it's not new.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] What do you mean when you say there's no new power? Is there anything you think you might be interested in?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Maybe, but I don't seem to have found the decoration that will make me so passionate again.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] So we can explore what kind of things, activities or interests might inspire your enthusiasm?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, it's safe to stay stable, but it's less fun to be challenged.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It seems you're thinking about the balance between stability and challenges. Would you like to try some small changes, see if they bring new feelings?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Indeed, the search for the world is less bold than it is for the fear of being caught in a trap again.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] So you think your dream has come true?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, in one way or another, it is only in the heart that there is still some unfulfilled expectation.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I heard you say that while dreams are realized, there are still unfulfilled expectations.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, sometimes it is, but there's a struggle inside.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Can you tell me more about this unsatisfied feeling?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Maybe it thinks it can do more, but it's now limiting itself.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like you have a lot of potential, but now it seems to be being held hostage by some restrictions.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Perhaps it expects more challenges and changes, rather than staying in place.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You expect new challenges and changes, not static, right?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, but there is still a lack of satisfaction and desire.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] So it's not just about being a table.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, it might have other forms and possibilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Or why it's a table.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] It is also a confusion that does not know what its true nature and mission is.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] What else? Maybe it was a tree.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Maybe it could be a ship to explore the unknown.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Or maybe it doesn't want to just make a table, maybe there's a lot of shape.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, a fixed definition may limit its unlimited possibilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Why can't it be an art?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Perhaps it has contained too much anger and discontent in its heart to be released.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] How intense is this anger for you? Do you sometimes miss the passions?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Sometimes, it feels like anger and passion make you more dynamic.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] What do you think when you mention this strong emotion? We have a few minutes to talk about it.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I am thinking of a desire to break the shackles and free the inner real forces.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] This release feeling may be attractive to you, right?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Maybe, go back to the primitive instincts and find yourself.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Do you feel that sometimes you lose some of your own real things to adapt to the expectations of society?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, that kind of adaptation takes a lot of real.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, I think that's interesting, and I'm sure you've got a lot of thinking. It's just that today may not really be much time to go on. I look forward to going on next time.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Indeed, it feels very much alive today, but there are still a lot of unfinished business.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I'm glad you feel that way.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] That reassures me to continue with the same person.\n",

            "[user] He didn't say explicitly that he didn't like me, or that he told me why he broke up, so I kept wondering whether I did something wrong or whether I was not good enough.\n",

            "[assistant] Did he say that to you before?\n",

            "\n",

            "[assistant] It'll make you feel very painful, won't it?\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, I always felt like he was gonna be nice to me, and he'd like me again, and we'd have a future.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand that it is very sad indeed to feel that fear and fear that he will no longer contact you.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, I always thought he didn't contact me, which means he never had a chance.\n",

            "[assistant] How's it going?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] We get along especially well when we're feeling good, like best friends, but we are now cold.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like your relationship has changed a lot.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I'm always afraid that people don't like me, try to meet their needs, and always get in the way.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand that this fear of being unattractive makes you more likely to make sacrifices in many cases.\n",

            "[assistant] You can look at yourself in this relationship, what you put yourself in, how you react, what you are in conflict, when there's no conflict, and that's more important than looking at him. It's more important to be behaved and feel when you're in a relationship.\n",

Focusing on yourself does not mean being indifferent to others, and they can coexist. It's actually to focus better on others. Okay, today's consultation is about as much time as it takes.

            "\n",
            "[assistant] Maybe they're worried they can't help you later, so they're really anxious to help you arrange these things. This push is stressful, right?\n",

            "\n",

            "[assistant] You mentioned giving up your work and life, which is a big decision for you, and do you think it's worth making this sacrifice for this relationship?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I might just calm down and see if there's a better way to communicate, or try to adjust my mind and think about what I really want.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like you're confused in this relationship, and you're also looking for ways to solve it.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, it feels like we need some time to calm down and think, but it's over if we really calm down.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand that concern, and a temporary calm may be providing an opportunity to revisit your relationship.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, he may feel that he has been paying and that I have not met his needs, and that imbalance has caused him to feel aggrieved and disgruntled.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like there's something in your relationship that makes him feel like he's not. You feel his frustration.\n",

            "[assistant] Waiting is really worrying and it is also a sign that you care about this relationship.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I think it would be better to meet and talk, but I fear that he'll make me feel even more sad.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] This fear is normal, and face-to-face communication may be more useful to you in your in-depth understanding of each other's feelings.\n",

            "[user] Yeah, his attitude was confusing to me and I didn't know how to deal with it.\n",

            "[assistant] I understand your confusion, and perhaps you could consider whether you could try to communicate with him again.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] But he now refuses to communicate, saying he should be quiet, and I do not know how to break the deadlock.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Indeed, this situation can be very weak. So, did he mention how long it would take to be quiet?\n",

            "\n",
            "[assistant] It seems that you are really interested in this relationship and hope to be able to address it positively. So before you do anything, have you thought about what it might be like to have it and whether you can accept it?\n",

            "[user] Well, I think you're right. I'll try to control my emotions and talk to him. I'll be prepared to face it, whatever the outcome. Thank you for your advice.\n",

            "[assistant] You mentioned that there are many problems between you, and can we say more specifically?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, that's true. There are a lot of problems in marriage, and he's not a person who cares about people. We were a little distant, but I've been trying to keep it alive.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Sounds like you're disappointed and depressed about this relationship. Can you tell me what keeps you going on with this marriage?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] He's not violent about my house, but he's usually a little cold and sometimes he's upset or even mad at me. I've been patient, but I've been a little bit impatient lately.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] So his behavior has caused you a lot of trouble, right?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Maybe because I don't want to give up on this marriage. And we're both that old, and it's not easy to start over. I always thought that if we had kids, everything might be okay, and I kept thinking about it.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Mm-hmm. How do you feel his love is expressed?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] He's got some good times for me, like when we make up, he's gonna care about me. I can still feel his feelings for me, but it's getting less and less.\n",

            "[assistant] Sounds like he's changed a lot in these changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, especially in recent months, because of the fact that his preparation was particularly busy and his mood was not very stable, I can't feel the warmth and the affection he had.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You mean, this change has a lot to do with his recent stress, right?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] No, he doesn't usually drink. I think it's more stress and life-related stuff that makes him so cold, considering the way we've been together for so long.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I can feel your disappointment with him, and you're hoping that he'll come back and care about you so he can continue to trust him, right?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I always wanted him to be the person who cared about me. I had been brave enough to communicate with him, but there was no substantial change at all, sometimes feeling weak.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You've been through a lot of hard times, and it must be hard for you. Have you ever thought about leaving or protecting yourself?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I did think about leaving a few times, but I was beaten every time. I was afraid I'd leave and never find anyone like him, and I went to my family to support me. I really am.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You can tell. You're still interested in the good old days, right?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I really miss thinking about the good times. I always feel like there's hope for going back, but it's getting harder.\n",

            "[assistant] What does he mean to you?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] He's not just a husband to me, he's part of my life. I feel like I have some goals and directions in my life, and even now we have a lot of problems, he's my closest.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] What do you think of \"get yourself together\" is exactly what it is?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I guess so. I always thought that if we could sit down and talk, maybe we could fix our relationship, not give up on this marriage, but it's like it's a waste of time.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] Well, what kind of concrete changes do you want him to make? What does he look like in the ideal?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] I want him to be more concerned and understand, sometimes to communicate with me, not to be indifferent. I want our relationship to return to the warm and loving state of the past, even if he is willing to work with me to have a child and to rekindle hope for life.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand that your expectations are specific, and that's important. So, what's your feeling about the problem?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] You're right, I know that leaving him might free me, but I also feel like losing the direction and the goal of life. The situation is bothering me, not knowing how to choose for myself.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It is normal that you now feel confused and hesitant, and in the face of such complex feelings, give yourself some time to understand and embrace their feelings, and to explore how they can be handled in their best interests.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yeah, I think so. It might take some time to think about it, to accept my current state, not to put too much pressure on myself.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It is quite normal to feel that contradiction.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, it's really very contradictory. On the one hand, you need to leave him and find yourself a new start, and on the other, you think you can try again, and maybe we can get better.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] You feel that way very real. Maybe you can give yourself some time and space to rest, really relax, listen to your inner voice, see what you really need. We can explore concrete actions slowly, without rushing to make decisions.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] You're right, I need more time and space for myself, to relax and listen to the real voice. Maybe it will help me see the current situation and the way forward more clearly.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] It's important to relax and listen to what you're talking about. Perhaps you can think about something that you're trying to do without time, like going to social events, learning new skills or travelling, so that these new experiences help you find direction.\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] Yes, I can try to start over, get into some social activities, do things that I've always wanted to do, like learn new skills or travel. I hope that helps me get into a dilemma.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] These sound like good plans. If you feel like you need them, we can continue our discussions next week and see how you're making it and how you feel.\n",

            "[user] Well, I'm actually preparing for World War II, but my profession is food, and I'm measuring my commitment to this. It's not good to look at employment. I think a lot when I want to quit. I want to work, but I feel scared again, like I'm out there.\n",

            "[assistant] Where did your evaluation system come from?\n",
            "\n",
            "[user] It's probably a habit to be older, to be compared with others, and to learn to compare with others.\n",

            "[assistant] What exactly is lack of talent?\n",

            "\n",
            "[user] It seems like that, I always felt I had to be successful and show up to be liked.\n",
            "\n",
            "[assistant] I understand how you feel. We live in a society that often emphasizes competition and performance, which allows us to think about whether our own values are in order. But, in fact, even without particularly remarkable achievements, many lives are beautiful and worthy of acceptance.\n",
